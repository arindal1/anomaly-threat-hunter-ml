# Intrusion Detection System

This project implements an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for network security, utilizing a Random Forest model to detect anomalies in network traffic.

## Introduction

Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) play a crucial role in maintaining network security. This project focuses on creating an IDS using a Random Forest machine learning model. The system predicts whether incoming network traffic is normal or represents a potential anomaly. The project aims to contribute to network security by providing a tool that can efficiently identify and classify various network intrusions. The ultimate vision is to enhance cybersecurity measures, enabling quicker responses to potential threats and ensuring a safer network environment. <br>

## The Code

### Data Loading and Exploration:
- You start by loading a dataset using Pandas from a CSV file: `'NSL-KDD/KDDTest+.txt'`.
- You display a random sample of 5 rows from the dataset using `df.sample(5)`.
- You check the shape of the dataset using `df.shape`.
- You display information about the dataset using `df.info()`.

### Column Names and Categorical Encoding:
- You define a list of column names.
- You assign these column names to the DataFrame `df`.
- You identify categorical columns and perform one-hot encoding on them using `pd.get_dummies`.

### Numeric Features and Scaling:
- You identify numeric columns.
- You apply Min-Max scaling to these numeric columns using `MinMaxScaler`.

### Target Label:
- You preprocess the target variable `target` to label attacks as 1 and normal as 0.

### Data Visualization:
- You use various visualization techniques to understand the data, such as pie charts, correlation heatmap, pairplot, distribution plots, and boxplots.

### Feature Selection:
- You use Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) with a RandomForestClassifier to select a certain number of features.

### Model Training:
- You split the dataset into features (`X`) and target (`y`).
- You split the data into training and testing sets using `train_test_split`.
- You train multiple models: RandomForestClassifier, SVM, Logistic Regression, and Neural Network (MLPClassifier).

### Model Evaluation:
- You evaluate the models using accuracy, precision, recall, false positive rate, area under ROC curve, and confusion matrix.

### Hyperparameter Tuning:
- You perform hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV for each model to find the best parameters.

### Ensemble Learning:
- You create an ensemble model using a VotingClassifier.

### Conclusion:
- You print the accuracy and metrics for each model, as well as the best parameters obtained from hyperparameter tuning.
- You also evaluate the ensemble model.

The code covers data preprocessing, visualization, feature selection, model training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning. It sets the stage for building a robust anomaly detection model, but further steps like selecting appropriate anomaly detection models and deploying the model are needed for a complete solution. If you have specific questions or need further clarification on any part, feel free to ask! <br>

## Dataset

The **NSL-KDD** dataset, short for *"NSL-KDD Network Traffic Data"*, is a widely used dataset in the field of intrusion detection and network security. It serves as a benchmark dataset for evaluating machine learning models and algorithms designed to detect various types of network intrusions.

### Key Features
- **Diversity:** The dataset includes a wide range of network intrusions, covering different attack types and protocols.
- **Realism:** The dataset is based on a more realistic representation of network traffic, addressing the shortcomings of the original KDD Cup 1999 dataset.
- **Labeling:** Each network connection in the dataset is labeled as either a normal connection or one of several attack types, allowing for supervised learning approaches.
- **Preprocessing:** The dataset provides preprocessed data, making it easier to apply machine learning techniques directly.
