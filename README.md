# Intrusion Detection System

This project implements an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for network security, utilizing a Random Forest model to detect anomalies in network traffic.

## Introduction

Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) play a crucial role in maintaining network security. This project focuses on creating an IDS using a Random Forest machine learning model. The system predicts whether incoming network traffic is normal or represents a potential anomaly.

## Features

- Utilizes a pre-trained Random Forest model to predict network traffic anomalies.
- Provides a simple and interactive web interface for users to input features.
- Enables users to visualize the predictions for network traffic.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Streamlit
- scikit-learn
- numpy
- pickle

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/intrusion-detection-system.git
   cd intrusion-detection-system
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. Access the app through your web browser at the provided URL (usually http://localhost:8501).
   
3. Input values for selected features.

4. Click "Predict" to get the system's prediction for network traffic.
