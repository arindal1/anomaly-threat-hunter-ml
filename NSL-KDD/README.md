# NSL-KDD Dataset

The NSL-KDD dataset, short for "NSL-KDD Network Traffic Data," is a widely used dataset in the field of intrusion detection and network security. It serves as a benchmark dataset for evaluating machine learning models and algorithms designed to detect various types of network intrusions.

## Overview

The NSL-KDD dataset was introduced to address the limitations of the original KDD Cup 1999 dataset, which had several shortcomings including redundancy and unrealistic traffic scenarios. The NSL-KDD dataset was created by addressing these issues, making it more suitable for intrusion detection research.

## Key Features

- **Diversity**: The dataset includes a wide range of network intrusions, covering different attack types and protocols.
- **Realism**: The dataset is based on a more realistic representation of network traffic, addressing the shortcomings of the original KDD Cup 1999 dataset.
- **Labeling**: Each network connection in the dataset is labeled as either a normal connection or one of several attack types, allowing for supervised learning approaches.
- **Preprocessing**: The dataset provides preprocessed data, making it easier to apply machine learning techniques directly.

## Usage

Researchers and practitioners use the NSL-KDD dataset to develop and evaluate intrusion detection systems, network security models, and machine learning algorithms. It's particularly valuable for:

- Training and evaluating machine learning models to classify network traffic as normal or malicious.
- Benchmarking intrusion detection algorithms.
- Experimenting with feature selection techniques.

## Dataset Composition

The NSL-KDD dataset is divided into training and testing sets, each containing a set of features related to network connections and their corresponding labels indicating normal or attack types.
